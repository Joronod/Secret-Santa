# Secret-Santa

## Overview

The Secret Santa App is a simple tool to organize and run a Secret Santa gift exchange. Participants can add their names, and the app will randomly assign them someone to give a gift to. Each participant's recipient is revealed in turn to keep the gifting process a surprise.

## Features

* Add Participants: Enter names of people who will be participating in the Secret Santa event.
* Random Assignment: The app shuffles and assigns each participant someone to buy a gift for, ensuring no one is assigned themselves.
* Revealing Process: Each participant's recipient is revealed in sequence, maintaining the surprise.
* User-Friendly Interface: Simple navigation between adding participants, starting the event, and revealing assignments.
## How to Use
* Add Participants: On the homepage, type in the names of participants and click "Add Santa" to add them to the list.
* Start the Exchange: Once at least two participants are added, a "Start" button appears. Click it to proceed.
* Reveal Assignments: Participants will take turns revealing who they are buying a gift for by clicking the "Reveal" button.
* Complete the Event: Once all assignments are revealed, the process is finished, and you can start again!
